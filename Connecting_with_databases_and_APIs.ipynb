        "Differences Between SQL and NoSQL Databases:\n",
        "\n",
        "SQL databases use a relational model, where data is stored in tables with rows and columns. Relationships between tables are\n",
        "established through foreign keys.\n",
        "NoSQL databases, on the other hand, use various models such as key-value stores, document-based,\n",
        "column-family, and graph databases, allowing for more flexible, unstructured, or semi-structured data.\n",
        "\n",
        "SQL databases have a fixed, predefined schema that requires data to fit into the structure before insertion.\n",
        "NoSQL databases offer a dynamic schema, meaning they can accommodate different types of data and allow changes in\n",
        "structure as the application evolves.\n",
        "\n",
        "SQL databases ensure strong consistency and follow ACID (Atomicity, Consistency, Isolation, Durability)\n",
        "properties, making them ideal for transactional applications that need to maintain data integrity.\n",
        "NoSQL databases typically prioritize availability and partition tolerance (as per the CAP theorem) over consistency,\n",
        "often supporting eventual consistency rather than strict ACID compliance.\n",
        "\n",
        "SQL databases primarily use vertical scaling (scaling by increasing the hardware capabilities of a single server). In contrast,\n",
        "NoSQL databases use horizontal scaling (scaling by adding more servers or nodes), which makes it easier to manage large datasets\n",
        "and handle high traffic.\n",
        "\n",
        "SQL databases use SQL (Structured Query Language) for querying data, which is standardized and allows for complex queries\n",
        "involving joins, aggregation, and filtering.\n",
        "NoSQL databases lack a standardized query language, with each database using its\n",
        "own query language or API depending on the data model used.\n",
        "\n",
        "SQL databases are best suited for applications with structured data, complex relationships, and a need for complex\n",
        "querying, such as banking systems or enterprise applications.\n",
        "NoSQL databases excel at handling large, distributed, or unstructured data, especially when the data schema\n",
        "is flexible or changes frequently, making them ideal for real-time analytics, social media platforms, and IoT systems.\n",
        "\n",
        "Examples of SQL databases include MySQL, PostgreSQL, Oracle, and Microsoft SQL Server. Examples of NoSQL databases\n",
